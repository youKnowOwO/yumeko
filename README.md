# History
> IF YOU ARE PERFECTIONIST PLEASE DON'T READ THIS

A long time ago i just want started my first production bot with alot of commands. But i had host problem, so i just want to backup it to Github. Unfortunately creating private repository isn't free like now. So here without doubt im releasing it to public with restructured code.
